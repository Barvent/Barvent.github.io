<p>FristiLeaks is an easy OSCP-like boot to root VM hosted on Vulnhub. The goal in this challenge is to obtain root in the box and read the flag.<br />
As stated in the Vulnhub page, there are minimum 2 ways to obtain a limited shell and 3 ways to obtain root.</p>
<h1>Network Scan</h1>
<p>In this case, the machine doesn’t tell us its IP address, so I used Nmap to scan the network and find it.

I know that 192.168.56.1 is the gateway and 192.168.56.10 is the Kali machine, so 192.168.56.128 must be the target box.
<br /><br /></p>
<h1>Port Scan</h1>
<p>The port scan reveals lots of open ports, including one which is unusally high.

<h1>FTP Anonymous Login</h1>
<p>Port 21 has a ftp server with anonymous access configured, as shown in the Nmap output.

Just from connecting we get a possible user (Harry) and using user = anonymous and any password we get anonymous access, with allows use to read a file with two possible usernames (Elly and John).

<p>Reading other people write-ups I found that Elly uses the password ylle for her ftp account, but I used another method to get access.
<br /><br /></p>
<h1>HTTP Port 80</h1>
<p>Here there isn’t anything interesting, using gobuster we can find that it is serving a home directory but I didn’t find anything useful.

<h1>Samba Enumeration</h1>
<p>Port 139 has a Samba server which allows Guest login. There isn’t anything interesting inside the shares, but using enum4linux we can enumerate the users.
