I"À<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am an informatics engineering student which is interested in operating systems, computer networks and cyber security. I like solving CTFs and trying new things during my free time, which helps me learn about different topics and fight boredom.<br />
I am planning on getting some cyber security certifications, but right now I am kind of a newbie in this field, so I need to learn more before even attempting them.
<br /></p>
<h2>Why I started this blog?</h2>
<p>There are two main reasons for this. As Iâ€™ve said before, I like trying new things, so I thought it would be interesting to learn how to use Github Pages and Jekyll, as well as trying to maintain a blog. 
<br />
Also, I want to contribute back to the CTF community, which helped me a lot to start when I started solving security related CTFs. By posting write-ups I can help other newbies with some problems they might have as well as practicing my reporting skills.</p>
